# vanillacoind-web-ui
A clean (unofficial) Node.js web ui for vanillacoind on Linux. It also has support for watch only addresses and shows exchange trading history from [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_vnl) and [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-VNL).

[Short video of the ui](https://vimeo.com/143471620).
